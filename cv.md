## About Me
I have worked in the legal profession for the past 15 years.

During my professional career, I have acquired extensive communication skills in both oral and business correspondence, as well as in the preparation of various types of documentation.

One of the significant qualities that allowed me to thoroughly develop the previous stage of my professional activity is the ability to find a common language with various groups of people whose interests do not always coincide. In my opinion, this is the key to achieving high results in such a highly intellectual sphere as information technology.

My many years of legal practice led me to the conviction that a significant result can be achieved only with close cooperation of specialists in various fields. The organization of such cooperation is one of my skills.

Currently, my life goals are further self-development, broadening my horizons and fully realizing my potential in the promising, dynamically developing field of information technology.
